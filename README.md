# user-data-cfe-image
This repository contains ground truth user counterfactual explanations for explaining the misclassifications of a CNN on images from (i) MNIST and (ii) Quickdraw.  

The original query images (that are misclassified by a CNN) and the corresponding counterfactual explanations generated by human users are provided. We also supply the predicted labels and the true labels.
